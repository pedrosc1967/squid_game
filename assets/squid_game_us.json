A group of masked guards in pink jumpsuits arrive and explain that players are all in deep financial debts, but will be given billions of won (offical Korean coin) as a monetary prize in case they are able to win six games over six days. The games are conducted by the Front Man, who is fully masked and dressed in black. Gi-hun befriends Player 001, the first person who joined the game.
